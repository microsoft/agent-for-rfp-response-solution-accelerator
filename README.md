# Agent for RFP Response

The AI Agent utilizes deep reasoning and autonomously processes RFP requests by parsing emails, summarizing, analyze, and generating high quality draft RFP response documents, saving employees time and streamlining RFP completion workflows.

These capabilities can be applied to numerous other use cases such as: create draft legal documents, create claim processing responses, create responses for customer or vendor inquiries, as long as there is good quality knowledge base that AI agent can utilize, and the AI Agent prompts are updated accordingly.

Solution overview
</h2>

The Agent for RFP response processes RFP documents and leverages its knowledge base to create a draft proposal posted autonomously in Microsoft Teams.

This includes a proposal summary, project plan, compliance & security considerations and a confidence score harnessing the capabilities of deep reasoning, autonomous triggers, generative AI orchestration, knowledge sources and workflow automation.

Leveraging Copilot Studio, Power Platform, Microsoft Teams and SharePoint,users are able to get a draft proposal in response to the RFP received by customers in Microsoft Teams autonomously by the Agent with no input needed. This multiplies user productivity, reduces RFP response time.

**Note:** This accelerator is not intended to be a production ready solution. The components can be extended through customization and configuration as desired to create a production ready solution. All components packaged have been done through an unmanaged solution, which allows users to be able to customize and extend the components post-deployment.

Business Use Case
</h2>

Below is a sample landing page of the solution accelerator after it is deployed, set up, and ready to be used:

|![image](./Deployment/Images/landingpage.png)|
|---|

<br/>

An organization receives a RFP document from a customer via email. This acts as the **autonomous trigger** for the RFP response agent to start creating a proposal for the received RFP. 

The agent starts this process by:

1. **Identifying the product** the customer is enquiring about from the email.
2. Once that's done, **using deep reasoning and generative AI orchestration**, the agent leverags it's **existing knowledge base of RFP's** submitted in the past to create a proposal including product specifications & services the organization offers.
3. The agent proceeds from here to create a section for compliance and security based on best practices from the org
4. Creates a section for a high level project plan on how the identified products & services will be delivered.
5. Gives a confidence score on the accuracy of the content.
6. Finally, the agent posts the draft proposal as an adaptive card in MS Teams in a deal room channel to meet the sellers in their system of productivity. From here, the users can collaborate on the document and finalize it for submission.

This agent reduces RFP completion time, enhances user productivity by already creating a version of the proposal by leveraging existing knowledge base and empowers the sellers to focus on the more challenging aspects of the RFP rather than spending time creating a document on content the organization already has access too.
